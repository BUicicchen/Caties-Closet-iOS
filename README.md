# Caties-Closet-iOS
Catie's Closet is a local Boston-based nonprofit working towards helping young students living in poverty get access to clean, donated clothes and toiletries at their schools. This iOS application helps facilitate the donation process by making it easy for anyone to sign up for a Catie's Closet account and donate in a variety of ways -- via Shipping, Drop-off, or Monetary Payment. Users will be able to see their donation history in a clean and convenient manner. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to make a difference, and see that they've made a difference.
